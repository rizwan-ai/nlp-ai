# NLP with AI

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Linguistics, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses algorithms to interpret and manipulate human language.

In the NLP with AI, you will learn how to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages, summarize text, and even build chatbots. These and other NLP applications will be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.

NLP is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning and is critical in effectively analyzing massive quantities of unstructured, text-heavy data. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.
